  For my serial question, I wanted to see if there was any warning signs to further Jewish related genaside.
  During this time period there were several articals relating pogroms happening in Russia. I want to
  examine these further and see the detail to which they explain the situations. I hope to find out some information
  from this as well as locations so I can create a map. Querying will make this process easy beacuase I will be 
  able to go through all of my classmates work.
